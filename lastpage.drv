%% This package was invented by
%% Jeffrey P. Goldberg (jeffrey+news at goldmark dot org).
%% I thought that a replacement was needed and therefore created the pageslts package,
%% https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pageslts
%% . Nevertheless, for compatibility with existing documents/packages as well as for
%% the low amount of resources needed by the lastpage package (no new counter!),
%% I updated this package.
%% Thanks go to Jeffrey P. Goldberg for allowing me to do this.
%% 
%% This work consists of the main source file lastpage.dtx,
%% the README, and the derived files
%%    lastpage.sty, lastpage.pdf,
%%    lastpage.ins, lastpage.drv,
%%    lastpage-example.tex, lastpage-example.pdf.
