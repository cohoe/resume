% Don't like 10pt? Try 11pt or 12pt
\documentclass[10pt]{article}

% The automated optical recognition software used to digitize resume
% information works best with fonts that do not have serifs. This
% command uses a sans serif font throughout. Uncomment both lines (or at
% least the second) to restore a Roman font (i.e., a font with serifs).
%%\usepackage{times}
%%\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

% The OCR software also has a hard time with italics. These commands get
% rid of the two common ways to italicize text in LaTeX. Get rid of them
% to turn italics back on.

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications

% Layout: Puts the section titles on left side of page

%
%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
